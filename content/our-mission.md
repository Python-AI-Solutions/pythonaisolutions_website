Integrity is the heart of our ethos, ensuring that every action we take is done with honesty, ethical conduct, and unwavering moral principles. This foundational value fosters trust and transparency with our clients, employees, and partners, creating a positive ripple effect throughout our industry and community.<br/><br/>Our commitment to digital stewardship complements our integrity: we navigate the evolving digital landscape ethically, balancing the use of open-source ecosystems and proprietary technologies to drive forward-thinking solutions while considering the profound impact our work has on society.<br/><br/>Antifragility— a system's or organization's capacity to grow stronger in response to stressors, volatility, and challenges— transforms how we perceive and interact with the world's inherent disorder. We turn potential disruptions into catalysts for growth and innovation. This approach allows us to lead in our industry with confidence, responding to new information and conditions with a forward-thinking mindset that actively seeks and uses change for continuous improvement. Thriving in the face of the unpredictable is a fundamental part of our identity.<br/><br/>Collaboration is the thread that weaves together our values, amplifying their impact. By fostering a culture of collaboration both internally and externally, we harness the collective power of diverse minds working towards a shared vision. This collaborative spirit extends beyond our organizational boundaries, engaging customers, communities, and partners in a co-creative process that ensures our solutions are grounded in real-world needs.<br/><br/>Together, these values form the pillars of our company and propel us towards achieving our mission of delivering exceptional value, driving long-lasting growth, and making a meaningful difference in the world.

Digital_Stewardship: <div id="3bbc3ecd" class="flex-element widget-wrapper" data-auto="flex-element-widget-wrapper" data-widget-type="paragraph" data-external-id="1586684080"> <div class="dmNewParagraph" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1586684080" data-ai-tag="Card 2: Short description" style=""><p style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 700;">Definition:</span><span class="" style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"> <span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">Digital stewardship encapsulates our commitment to ethically navigating and enriching the digital landscape, which includes both open and closed proprietary technologies. In the rapidly evolving domain of AI, this stewardship takes on a critical role. While we ideally lean towards use of open tools because of their accessibility and communal innovation, we recognize that the significant investments and risk-taking involved in the creation of proprietary solutions often result in their leading the way in cutting-edge developments. Our stewardship involves making conscientious choices about when and how to integrate proprietary solutions, ensuring they align with our ethical standards and contribute positively to our clients’ needs and the broader digital community. This balanced approach allows us to harness state-of-the-art technology responsibly, reflecting a deep consideration for the profound impact AI will have on society.</span></span></p><p style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 700;">How we practice digital stewardship:</span></p> <ul class="defaultList bullet"><li style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">Community engagement: Enriching digital communities through active participation, knowledge sharing, and advocacy for open-source contributions and ethical standards within our industry.</span></li><li style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">Financial support: Investing in the sustainability of critical open-source and digital platforms, especially those lacking commercial support.</span></li><li style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">Responsible integration of AI: Employing AI solutions—both proprietary and open—in a manner that is ethical, transparent, and aligned with societal benefit.</span></li><li style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">Ethical data practices: Ensuring responsible data use, prioritizing privacy, and striving to eliminate biases.</span></li></ul> <p style="line-height: 1.2;"><span style="display: initial;"><br></span><span class="" style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 700;"> <span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 700;">Why it matters</span></span><span class="" style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"> <span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">The digital infrastructure, much like its physical counterpart, requires active engagement for its sustenance and growth. Open-source software and open technologies/platforms (which thrive on community contributions) have a profound democratizing effect on technology access. At the same time, blending this open innovation with proprietary tools presents opportunity. By adopting digital stewardship, we commit to thoughtful engagement with and improvement of this ecosystem, mindful of the ethical complexities inherent in AI development and deployment. This stewardship ensures that our contributions and choices both bolster the health of the digital commons and align with our commitment to ethical and sustainable business practices.</span></span></p></div> </div>
